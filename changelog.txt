Date: 2020-10-11 21:00
  Optimisations:
    - Changed update nth_tick timer to run less frequently in hope of better performance.

      Some more optimisations are planned for future updates.

Date: 2020-10-03 23:00

      https://mods.factorio.com/mod/HandyHands/discussion/5f4835edfc56aff0abec3b15
  Bugfixes:
    - On init the shortcut state is correctly toggled on now
  Support:
    - And thanks to imnotlaughin for suggesting I make a Patreon page (patreon.com/Qon) and for being my first patron!
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 1.11.0
Date: 2020-09-07 13:00
  Changes:
    - There's now a setting (defaults to off) for enabling autocrafting of recipes with multiple products.
      Thanks to imnotlaughin for [reporting issues](https://mods.factorio.com/mod/HandyHands/discussion/5f4e44950c7bd941cd2f66ad)
      with the previous behaviour!
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 1.10.0
  Major Features:
    - HandyHands can now treat personal logistics requests as autocraft requests. This will enable personal
      logistics slots for all forces that have a player that wants this (whole force because of Factorio engine/API).
      It will not enable any recipes or other bonuses like trash slots that the research that otherwise
      enables this, and it will not affect any research. The mod will never disable personal logistics slots.
      This feature was implemented for the related request to have a [GUI for HandyHands requests](https://mods.factorio.com/mod/HandyHands/discussion/5ca91a7c6ffc54000bfac1c5)
    - There's a setting so that treating quickbar slots as autocraft requests is optional.
      This is still possible to achieve with the old method: setting the default request amount to 0.
      This setting means you can set it up before the game starts and only use logistics requests
      and individual item HandyHands settings (with the hotkeys) and you don't have to spam J a bunch
      of times in each new world.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 1.9.0
  Bugfixes:
    - HandyHands can now deal with recipes that are internally named differently to its products.
      This should fix incompabilities with all mods that name their recipes without regard to
      conventions, when there's several recipes that produce the same thing or recipes that produce
      several things at once.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 1.8.1
  Bugfixes:
    - When stacksizes are modified (>500) HandyHands pretends they are size/10. Not the printout reflects this
      and shows how many items will actually be autocrafted.
      Thanks to Raymonzut fot this fix!
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 1.8.0
  Info:
    - Updated for Factorio v0.18
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 1.7.15
  Changes:
    - Updated dependencies to exclude Factorio < 0.17.12
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 1.7.14
  Bugfixes:
    - Fixed a bug that crashed HandyHands if your settings contained settings for items that were later removed.
      Thanks to Razunter for [reporting](https://mods.factorio.com/mod/HandyHands/discussion/5ce7f87e78d342000bbf7eeb)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 1.7.13
  Optimisations:
    - Thanks to OvermindDL1 and Morcam for reporting a [performance issue](https://mods.factorio.com/mod/HandyHands/discussion/5cb2d0aa4ec28f000bcc41d4)
      and again to Morcam for also [suggesting a fix](https://mods.factorio.com/mod/HandyHands/discussion/5cde4b427b286b000c4ed671)
      for when mods add a lot of recipes which caused UPS problems with HandyHands. Due to parts of the factorio API being not that optimized and
      called needlessly.
  Changes:
    - Some refactoring and cleanup of the code.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 1.7.12
  Bugfixes:
    - Fixed a crash. Well it's an attempt at least.
      Reported by Recon777 https://mods.factorio.com/mod/HandyHands/discussion/5cd9b1ed0a8bc6000c0b7ee4
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 1.7.11
  Bugfixes:
    - Fixed an internal function (filter).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 1.7.10
  Bugfixes:
    - Fixed the player/character breaking mod api change in Factorio 0.17.35.
      You will need to update to at least [Factorio 0.17.35] for this to work for you.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 1.7.9
  Features:
    - Added a shortcut toggle button for enabling/pausing and show you current enable state.
      Current icon kindly provided by drd_avel. It wasn't intended by the artist for such a tiny button,
      that silly decision is my fault. But I'm not a graphic artist so I'm pushing the 144x144 icon I have and push it into the 32x32 slot.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 1.7.8
  Changes:
    - Altered crafting sound playing logic slightly.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 1.7.7
  Info:
    - Changed item printout so that it uses fancy icons in messages. Go [item=assembling-machine-2] stuff!

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 1.7.6
  Bugfixes:
    - Fixed a rare crash reported by OvermindDL1 - https://mods.factorio.com/mod/HandyHands/discussion/5ca909a96ffc54000d0a7e3e

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 1.7.5
  Info:
    - Changed changelog format for the changelog parser.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 1.7.4
  Sounds:
    - Re-Enabled playing sounds for hand crafting that was started manually, with a setting to disable the sound for completed crafts started by HandyHands.
      The sound plays at a approximation of the logic Factorio uses to decide if sounds should be played because of limitations in documentation and the mod API.
      I might be able to improve this further in the future. But it should be better than just all on or off for all at least.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 1.7.3
  Sounds:
    - Disabled the crafting_finished sound because it was commonly requested.
      It is currently disabled for all manual handcrafting not started by HH also.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 1.7.2
  Features:
    - Enabled autocrafting of items in your main inventory that are not on your quickbar if you have manually set a crafting amount for that item.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 1.7.1
  Bugfixes:
    - Fixed a crash when using the editor.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 1.7.0
  Other:
    - Updated to work with Factorio v0.17!

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 1.5.1
  Locale:
    - Fixed locale according to new 0.15 format.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 1.5.0
  Other:
    - Updated "factorio_version" to 0.15
  Changes:
    - Changed default hotkeys to U & J instead of I & K since factorio 0.15 uses K for something else.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 1.4.0
  Optimisations:
    - Some performance impovements
  Modding:
    - added 'paused' to the remote interface to s/get paused state for players

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 1.3.0
  Other:
    - Works with factorio_version 0.14

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 1.2.4
  Bugfixes:
    - Factorio crash workaround (Thanks Nexela, Riffz711) and ghost checks for multiplayer deaths.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 1.2.3
  Bugfixes:
    - Fixed migration bugs causing loss of HandyHands setting if loading a savefile made with HandyHands 1.2.x in a later version.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 1.2.2
  Bugfixes:
    - Fixed error when loading old saves without the mod installed. Thanks R3CONN3R for reporting!

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 1.2.1
  Bugfixes:
    - Fixed error when autocrafting in god mode. Thanks again mindmix for finding...

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 1.2.0
  Features:
    - Ammo crafting! Treat ammo slots as if they were filtered with the ammo they contain.
      firearms-magazine defaults to 0.05 stacks on first join so that you don't lose your starting iron.
    - Default stack size is 0.2
    - Pause feature! If you cancel a craft that was started by HandyHands then the autocrafting is paused.
    - Treat stacks >= 500 is if they were 1/10 the size. So a setting of 1 stack of a 500 stack item just gives you 50.
      The text output doesn't give you this info yet.
    - New autocraft limits available: 0.2 and 0.8 stacks. (and all the others are still there) Settings code is now easier to modify for other stack sizes.
  Modding:
    - Remote interfaces added for coders who want to read or set HandyHands settings. Also the code was restructured and commented for readability.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 1.1.2
  Bugfixes:
    - Implemented the other half of the bugfix that was started in v.1.1.1

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 1.1.1
  Bugfixes:
    - Fixed error when autocrafting in god mode. Thanks mindmix for finding!

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 1.1.0
  Major Features:
    - Use hotkeys to choose the amount of stacks you want to autocraft.
    - If you hold something in your hand and use the hotkeys you change the setting
      for that item.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 1.0.2
  Bugfixes:
    - Limits autocrafting to trash slot amount when it's lower than the stack size.
      This means you don't constantly craft items that go straight to trash slots.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 1.0.1
  Bugfixes:
    - Fix crash when there is no recipe for a certain item.
    - Better support for cheat_mode.
      * Now disregards if recipe is researched when cheat mode is on.
      * Now disregards if there are enough ingredients for crafting the item when cheat_mode is on.
      * Crafts the amount needed for full stack instead of 1 at a time since it's instant with cheat_mode.
      * Still doesn't craft raw-fish in cheat mode though since it has no recipe.
  Optimisations:
    - Small performance tweaks.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 1.0.0
  Major Features:
    - Initial release
